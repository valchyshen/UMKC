An impossibility theorem sets the stage for the analysis of reform alternatives. Then, the relative merits of alternative exchange rate regimes and of different degrees of capital-market-flow regulation are considered. The paper concludes by opting for a combination of : floating exchange rates; slowing down and taxing foreign capital inflows; and greater national economic sovereignty.}

abstract = {The argument of this paper is that growing capital mobility is unavoidable. Domestic financial liberalization and the revolution in information and communications technologies make it much more difficult to stop capital flows at the border. Effective controls will therefore have to become increasingly comprehensive, onerous, and distortionary. The issue is therefore how to cope with the reality of high capital mobility and to manage the transition. This means not freeing capital flows before substantial progress has been made in liberalizing domestic financial markets and strengthening financial supervision. It means liberalizing foreign direct investment first, access to stock and bond markets second, and offshore bank-funding last. It means putting in place exchange rate, monetary and fiscal policies that do not destabilize the capital account. It means reforming monetary and fiscal institutions to assure the markets of the capacity to deliver desirable monetary and fiscal outcomes.}

author = {Paul Davidson},
abstract = {The paper starts with a critical review of two alternative theories of capital markets: neoclassical efficient-market theories and Keynesian liquidity preference theories, which differ radically in their views concerning the functions and operation of capital markets. Contrasting the experience of the global economy in the pre- and post-Bretton Woods eras, the author finds that the facts do not support the efficient-markets hypothesis. Indeed, instead of fulfilling the utopian promises of greater stability, more rapid growth and full employment predicted by efficient-markets theorists, liberalization of capital flows in the post-Bretton Woods era has been associated with exchange rate instability, financial crises, slower global economic growth and greater unemployment. The theoretical implication of the contrast between theoretical expectations and performance is that a Keynesian reformulation of the micro-foundations of economic analysis is required. The policy implications are that a return to a fixed-exchange rate regime, coupled with restraints on the international movement of capital and supported by a clearing-union, are essential. The paper concludes with a proposal for a comprehensive, interconnected package of reforms.}

  abstract = {Motivated by debates surrounding international capital flows during the Great Recession, we conduct a positive and normative analysis of capital flows when a region of the global economy experiences a liquidity trap. Capital flows reduce inefficient output fluctuations in this region by inducing exchange rate movements that reallocate expenditure towards the goods it produces. Restricting capital mobility hampers such an adjustment. From a global perspective, constrained efficiency entails subsidizing capital flows to address an aggregate demand externality associated with exchange rate movements. Absent cooperation, however, dynamic terms-of-trade manipulation motives drive countries to inefficiently restrict capital flows, impeding aggregate demand stabilization.}

  abstract = {The term "Washington Consensus" was originally used to describe a list often reforms that I argued were practically universally agreed in Washington to be desirable in most Latin American countries as of 1989. It acquired alternative meanings over the years, one of which was a summary of the policies toward their client countries of the Washington-based international financial institutions (IFIs), and another of which was what critics imagined the policies of those institutions to be (a list that tends to consist of policies that never did command a consensus, even in Washington). It is argued that in its original sense, the Washington Consensus consists of policies that still amount to a sensible-but incomplete-reform agenda, but that some of the deviations between my original list and what the IFIs have advocated are undesirable. However, even the original list needs to be supplemented in order to provide a policy agenda for Latin America today. The paper sketches the reform agenda recently laid out by a group of Latin American economists and published by the Institute for International Economics, which adds countercyclical macro policies, institutional reforms, and a concern with income distribution to the original emphasis on liberalization.},

 abstract = {In the past two decades, in a series of banking crises around the world, banks have become systematically insolvent. These crises have occurred in developed and developing economies alike. To make such financial system breakdowns less likely and to limit their costs if they occur, policymakers feel the need for financial safety nets. These include such policies as implicit or explicit deposit insurance, a lender of last resort function of the central bank, bank insolvency resolution procedures, and bank regulation and supervision. Of these policies, explicit deposit insurance has been gaining popularity in recent years. Since the 1980s the number of countries with explicit deposit insurance schemes almost tripled, with most OECD countries and an increasing number of developing economies adopting some form of explicit depositor protection. In 1994 deposit insurance became the standard for the newly created single banking market of the European Union. Establishing an explicit deposit insurance scheme became part of the generally accepted best practice advice given to developing economies.},

 abstract = {The globalization of finance in recent years and the concurrent growth in the financial sector's influence, manifested most dramatically in the recent financial crisis, highlights the importance for political scientists of understanding the political economy of global finance. The authors review six important books that are representative of recent thinking by political scientists on the topic. They address the central questions that have been at the heart of the literature on global finance from its beginning in new and interesting ways. The most important developments highlighted in this article are the move from a predominant focus on state-centered patterns of regulation to the consideration of transnational governance regimes that mix public and private regulation; the effort to understand the causal forces that shape the political economy of global finance by allowing for an interaction among interests, institutions, and ideas; and giving increased attention to new sources of systemic risk in the global financial system, as well to the consequences for domestic politics of interactions with the global financial system. Notwithstanding the progress that has been made in coming to grips with the political economy of global finance, the authors highlight a number of questions that need to be addressed in future research. Although various nonstate actors have been recognized as important in the constitution of the rules of global finance, it is also necessary to understand the behavior of the actors who enact these rules. It is also important to generate evidence that forges some agreement on the causes of the globalization of finance, especially as the arguments made become more complex. Finally, there is a need for a more realistic assessment of the costs and benefits of financialization at the global and national levels. This last challenge is essential for a thorough understanding of the current global financial crisis.},

 abstract = {Of all the many changes of the world economy since World War II, few have been nearly so dramatic as the resurrection of global finance. A review of five recent books suggests considerable diversity of opinion concerning both the causes and the consequences of financial globalization, leaving much room for further research. Competing historical interpretations, stressing the contrasting roles of market forces and government policies, need to be reexamined for dynamic linkages among the variables they identify. Likewise, impacts on state policy at both the macro and micro levels should be explored more systematically to understand not just whether constraints may be imposed on governments but also how and under what conditions, and what policymakers can do about them. Finally, questions are also raised about implications for the underlying paradigm conventionally used for the study of international political economy and international relations more generally.},

It concludes by noting that replacing the Consensus will require not only a reform of the international financial architecture, but a return to the integrated policy framework represented in the Havana Charter.},

    year = {2019},

    abstract = "{From the early eighteenth century into the 1830s, Great Britain was the only major country in the world to adopt gold as the sole basis of its currency, in the process absorbing much of the world's supply of that metal into its pockets, cupboards, and coffers. During the same period, Britons forged a nation by distilling a heady brew of Protestantism, commerce, and military might, while preserving important features of its older social hierarchy. All That Glittered argues for a close connection between these occurrences, by linking justifications for gold's role in British society-starting in the 1750s and running through the mid-nineteenth century gold rushes in California and Australia-to contemporary descriptions of that metal's varied values at home and abroad. Most of these accounts attributed British commercial and military success to a credit economy pinned on gold, stigmatized southern European and subaltern peoples for their nonmonetary uses of gold, or tried to marginalize people at home for similar forms of alleged misconduct. This book tells a primarily cultural origin story about the gold standard's emergence after 1850 as an international monetary system, while providing a new window on British exceptionalism during the previous century.}",

Within the SCA framework, the last stage of a hegemonic cycle is characterized by what is called 'systemic chaos'. However, the drivers of these dynamics have not been explicitly analyzed. This article fills this gap by providing a link between the accumulation process and systemic chaos. Introducing the logistic map into the SCA analysis, our approach provides the missing detailed understanding of how systemic chaos is an outcome of the contradictory socioeconomic dynamics of capital accumulation itself while being based on the key insights of the SCA framework of hegemonic cycles.}",
